"# OFlearn" 

⭐ Overview

OFlearn is a prototype of a modern learning platform created as a school project with friends.
I was fully responsible for designing the website, building the UI/UX, and creating the overall structure of the platform.

The platform is designed to help students access course materials, tests, chat spaces, and premium educational services in a clean and intuitive interface.

> 📌 Note: Lessons and tests have not been added because all educational content requires prior approval from trainers (because the project is related to the school).

🎯 Features:

  📚 Core Pages:
    Home – platform introduction
    OFlearn Pro – premium services page
    Courses – placeholder structure ready for future content
    Tests – exam & quiz section
    Chat – concept page for student communication
    Login / SignUp – authentication pages

  🎨 Modern UI/UX:
    A clean, engaging interface with icons, visuals, and smooth layout.

  💻 Responsive Design:
    Fully responsive across desktop only.

  ⚙️ Well-structured Code:
    Organized files and sections ready for future expansion.

  🎨 Brand Identity:
    custom colors, icons, and glow-style interface.

  ➕Add features:
    use FlexBox and Animation with css no js.
